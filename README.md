The robotic car can be controlled wirelessly via voice commands directly from the user. The robot can move forward, backward, left, and right and can also be stopped.

The Arduino voice-controlled robot car is interfaced with a Bluetooth module HC-05 or HC-06. We can give specific voice commands to the robot through an Android app installed on the phone. At the receiving side, a Bluetooth transceiver module receives the commands and forwards them to the Arduino and thus the robotic car is controlled.
